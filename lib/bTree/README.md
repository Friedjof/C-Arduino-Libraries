# BTree Library for Arduino

## Overview
This BTree library for Arduino provides an implementation of the B-Tree data structure, offering efficient mechanisms for storing, searching, and navigating through a large set of ordered data. B-Trees are widely used in databases and file systems to allow for quick data retrieval, insertions, and deletions while maintaining a balanced tree structure.

## Key Features
* Balanced Tree Structure: Ensures that the tree remains balanced, providing efficient data access times.
* Efficient Storage and Retrieval: Utilizes a node-based structure to efficiently store data and support rapid retrieval operations.
* Support for Dynamic Updates: Seamlessly handles insertions and deletions, ensuring the tree remains optimally balanced.
* Traversal and Search: Enables in-order traversal of the tree and supports effective searching for specific keys.
* Customizable Degree: Allows for customization of the tree's minimum degree, accommodating various use cases and optimizing performance.

# Usage
To utilize the BTree library, include BTREE_H in your Arduino project and instantiate a BTree object specifying the minimum degree for the tree.

# Example Usage
Below is a simple example demonstrating how to create a B-Tree, insert elements, and perform a search operation:

```cpp
#include "BTree"

// Define the minimum degree for the B-Tree
const int t = 3;

// Initialize a B-Tree with integers and a minimum degree of t
BTree<int> myBTree(t);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);

  // Insert elements into the B-Tree
  myBTree.insert(1);
  myBTree.insert(5);
  myBTree.insert(10);

  // Search for an element in the B-Tree
  BTreeNode<int>* result = myBTree.search(5);
  if (result != nullptr) {
    Serial.println("Element found in the B-Tree.");
  } else {
    Serial.println("Element not found in the B-Tree.");
  }
}

void loop() {
  // Placeholder for loop() method
}
```

## Customization
Adjust the minimum degree (t) of the B-Tree according to your dataset's size and your application's specific requirements to optimize performance.
