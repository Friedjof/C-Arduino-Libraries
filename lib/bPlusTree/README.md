# B+ Tree Library for Arduino

## Overview
The B+ Tree library for Arduino offers an efficient implementation of the B+ tree data structure, catering to applications that require a balanced tree for rapid data retrieval, insertion, and deletion. B+ trees are especially useful for database and filesystem implementations due to their ability to maintain sorted data and support efficient range queries.

## Key Features
* Balanced Tree Structure: Ensures all leaf nodes are at the same level, providing uniform access times.
* Efficient Storage: Optimizes space by storing keys in internal nodes and values in leaf nodes, making it ideal for large datasets.
* Dynamic Insertion and Deletion: Supports dynamic updates while maintaining balance, ensuring optimal performance.
* Range Queries: Facilitates efficient execution of range queries, returning all values within a given range quickly.
* Traversal and Search: Provides methods for tree traversal and searching specific keys, offering fast access to data.

## Usage
To use the B+ Tree library, include the B_PLUS_TREE.h header in your Arduino sketch and instantiate a BPlusTree object with the desired minimum degree.

Here is a simple example that demonstrates how to create a B+ Tree, insert keys, and perform a search:

```cpp
#include "BPlusTree.h"

// Initialize a B+ tree with a minimum degree of 3
BPlusTree<int> myTree(3);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);

  // Insert keys into the B+ tree
  myTree.insert(10);
  myTree.insert(20);
  myTree.insert(30);

  // Search for a key in the B+ tree
  BPlusTreeNode<int>* found = myTree.search(myTree.getRoot(), 20);
  if (found != nullptr) {
    Serial.println("Key found!");
  } else {
    Serial.println("Key not found.");
  }
}

void loop() {
  // Placeholder for loop logic
}
```
## Customization
The library can be customized for different data types and applications. You can adjust the minimum degree based on your dataset size and access patterns to optimize performance.
