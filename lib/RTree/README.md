# R-Tree Library for Arduino

## Overview
The R-Tree library for Arduino provides a spatial index structure for efficiently organizing and querying geometric data, such as rectangles or spatial objects. It's particularly useful for applications requiring spatial searches, like collision detection, viewport queries, or geographic information systems.

## Features
* Geometric Data Management: Efficiently stores and manages rectangles, supporting operations like insertion, deletion, and spatial queries.
* Spatial Queries: Supports querying data within a specified geometric range.
* Traversal Orders: Offers multiple tree traversal orders including pre-order, in-order, post-order, and level-order.
* Dynamic Tree Structure: Automatically adjusts its structure for optimal performance as data is added or removed.

## Usage
To use the R-Tree library in your Arduino project, include it at the beginning of your sketch:

```cpp

#include "RTree.h"
```
## Creating an R-Tree
Instantiate an R-Tree object specifying the data type:

```cpp

RTree<int> tree;
```
## Inserting Data
Insert rectangles into the tree:

```cpp

Rectangle<int> rect1 = {0, 0, 10, 10};
Rectangle<int> rect2 = {5, 5, 15, 15};
tree.insert(rect1);
tree.insert(rect2);
```

## Removing Data
Remove a rectangle from the tree:

```cpp

tree.remove(rect1);
```
## Searching
Search for a rectangle in the tree (example function, actual search implementation might vary based on specific needs):

```cpp

Rectangle<int> searchRect = {1, 1, 9, 9};
bool found = tree.search(searchRect);
if (found) {
    Serial.println("Rectangle found.");
} else {
    Serial.println("Rectangle not found.");
}
```
## Clearing the Tree
Remove all elements from the tree:

```cpp

tree.clear();
```
## Traversal and Printing
Print the tree contents in different traversal orders:

```cpp

tree.print(PRE_ORDER);
tree.print(IN_ORDER);
tree.print(POST_ORDER);
tree.print(LEVEL_ORDER);
```
## Applications
R-Trees are ideal for a wide range of applications that require spatial data indexing and queries, including:

* Geographic Information Systems (GIS).
* Collision detection in gaming and simulations.
* Spatial data analysis and visualization.
* Database index structures for spatial querying.
``RECOMMENDED FOR MICROCONTROLLERS/MICROPROCESSORS WITH MORE MEMORY CAPABILITY. (UNO, and NANO ARE NOT GOING TO WORK :) )``
``RECOMMEND USING DEVICES LIKE THE RASPBERRY PI, ARDUINO GIGA, ARDUINO MEGA, etc...``

## Customization
While the R-Tree library is designed to be generic, specific applications might require customization, such as supporting different geometric shapes, optimizing for specific query patterns, or enhancing memory management strategies.
