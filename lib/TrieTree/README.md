# Trie Tree Library for Arduino

## Overview
The Trie Tree library is a specialized data structure for handling a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are strings. It excels in solving problems related to word validations, auto-completion, and prefix searching, making it ideal for applications that deal with large datasets of words or characters, such as dictionaries, word games, or text processing tools.

## Features
* Word Insertion: Efficiently inserts words into the trie for later retrieval or matching.
* Word Search: Quickly determines if a word is present in the trie.
* Prefix Search: Checks whether there is any word in the trie that starts with the given prefix, useful for auto-completion features.
* Print All Words: Traverses the trie and prints all stored words, aiding in debugging or visualization of the trie's contents.
* AutoComplete: Given a prefix, the library can suggest all words that complete the prefix, simulating an auto-complete feature.
* Clear Trie: Allows for resetting the trie, removing all inserted words to start afresh.
* Erase Word: Removes a specific word from the trie, if present.

## Usage
To use the Trie Tree library in your Arduino project, include it at the beginning of your sketch:

```cpp

#include "TrieTree.h"
```

## Creating a Trie Tree
Instantiate a Trie Tree object:

```cpp

TrieTree myTrie;
```

## Inserting Words
Add words to the trie:

```cpp

myTrie.insert("hello");
myTrie.insert("world");
```
## Searching for Words
Check if a word exists in the trie:

```cpp

if(myTrie.search("hello")) {
    Serial.println("Found 'hello'");
}
```
## Prefix Search
Verify if any word in the trie starts with a given prefix:

```cpp

if(myTrie.startsWith("he")) {
    Serial.println("Prefix 'he' found");
}
```
## Printing All Words
Display all words stored in the trie:

```cpp

myTrie.printAllWords();
```

## Auto-Completion
Suggest words based on a prefix:

```cpp

SimpleVector<String> suggestions = myTrie.autoComplete("wo");
for(String word : suggestions) {
    Serial.println(word);
}
```

## Applications
* Text Editors: Implementing features like spell-checking and auto-completion.
* Games: Creating word games or puzzles that require fast validation of word existence or generation of possible word options.
* Educational Software: Assisting in teaching languages, vocabulary, and spelling.
* Search Engines: Quick prefix-based search suggestions.
* Data Analysis: Processing and analyzing large volumes of textual data for patterns or trends.

## Customization
The library can be extended or customized to include more complex functionalities such as handling different languages, case sensitivity options, or integrating with external storage for handling extremely large datasets.
