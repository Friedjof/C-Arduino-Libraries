# Binary Tree Library for Arduino

## Overview
The Binary Tree library for Arduino provides a comprehensive implementation for managing binary trees. Binary trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science, used in various applications such as sorting, data storage, and more. This library enables the creation, manipulation, and traversal of binary trees directly on your Arduino projects.

## Key Features
* Dynamic Tree Creation: Easily create and manage binary trees with any type of data.
* CRUD Operations: Supports insert, search, and delete operations.
* Traversal Methods: Includes in-order, pre-order, post-order, and level-order traversal methods for exploring your trees.
* Utility Functions: Functions to calculate height, count leaves, find minimum and maximum values, and more.
* Mirroring: Ability to mirror the binary tree, swapping left and right children of all nodes.
* Memory Management: Efficiently manages memory to ensure the stability of your Arduino projects.

## Usage
To utilize the BinaryTree library in your project, include the BinaryTree.h header and instantiate a BinaryTree object. Here's a basic example demonstrating some of the library's functionalities:

```cpp
#include "BinaryTree.h"

BinaryTree<int> myTree;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  
  // Insert data into the binary tree
  myTree.insert(50);
  myTree.insert(30);
  myTree.insert(70);
  
  // Perform an in-order traversal
  Serial.println("In-order Traversal:");
  myTree.inorder();
  
  // Find the maximum value in the binary tree
  Serial.print("Maximum Value: ");
  Serial.println(myTree.findMax());
  
  // Mirror the binary tree
  myTree.mirror();
  
  // Perform a level-order traversal on the mirrored tree
  Serial.println("Level-order Traversal of Mirrored Tree:");
  myTree.levelorder();
}

void loop() {
  // Placeholder for loop logic
}
```

## Customization and Extension
The library is templated, allowing it to work with any data type that supports comparison operators.
You can extend the library to include additional tree operations as needed, such as balancing the tree or implementing specific traversal algorithms.

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! If you have improvements or bug fixes, please feel free to contribute to the library. Your input is valuable in making this library more robust and feature-rich.
