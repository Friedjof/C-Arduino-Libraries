# Initializer List Library for Arduino

## Overview
The Initializer List library provides a minimal and efficient implementation of initializer lists for Arduino, similar to the C++11 feature. It allows Arduino developers to initialize objects and arrays in a clean and concise way, improving code readability and maintainability.

## Key Features
Standard-Compatible Types: Offers types such as value_type, reference, const_reference, size_type, iterator, and const_iterator for compatibility with standard C++ initializer list behavior.
Size and Iteration: Supports querying the size of the initializer list and provides iterator access to its elements, enabling range-based for loops and standard iteration patterns.
No Dynamic Memory: Operates without dynamic memory allocation, ensuring predictability and efficiency, crucial for memory-constrained environments like Arduino.

## Usage
This library is intended to be used where fixed-size, compile-time initializer lists are beneficial, such as static configuration data, pin mappings, or predefined sequences of values.

## Example Usage
Here's an example demonstrating how to use the initializer_list library to initialize and process a list of integers:

```cpp

#include "INITIALIZER_LIST_H"

void processList(const initializer_list<int>& list) {
  for (auto item : list) {
    Serial.println(item);
  }
}

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  // Wait for the serial monitor to open
  while (!Serial) {}

  // Initialize a list of integers using initializer_list
  initializer_list<int> myList = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

  // Process and print the list
  processList(myList);
}

void loop() {
  // Your loop code here
}
```
## Customization
The initializer_list template can be instantiated with any type, allowing it to be used with a wide range of data types beyond primitives, including custom classes and structures, provided they are copyable.

## Contribution
Contributions to enhance the functionality, extend the usage scenarios, or improve the documentation of the Initializer List library are welcome. Your input can help make this library a valuable resource for the Arduino community.
